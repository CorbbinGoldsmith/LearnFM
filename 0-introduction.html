            <h1 id="section-0-introduction" class="custom-heading">Section 0 - Introduction</h1><p>Welcome to the FM8 Advanced Tutorial for Ableton Live. In this comprehensive guide, we will dive deep into the powerful features and capabilities of Native Instruments&#39; FM8 synthesizer, and explore how to effectively integrate it into your Ableton Live productions.</p>
<p>FM8 is a versatile and complex software synthesizer that offers a vast array of sound design possibilities through its advanced FM synthesis engine, extensive modulation options, and intuitive interface. Whether you are a seasoned producer or just starting your journey into the world of synthesis, this tutorial will provide you with the knowledge and techniques needed to unlock the full potential of FM8 within Ableton Live.</p>
<p>Throughout this tutorial, we will cover a wide range of topics, starting with the basics of FM8&#39;s interface, operators, envelopes, routing, effects, pitch, master section, morph capabilities, modulation matrix, and key scaling. We will then delve into more advanced concepts such as additive synthesis techniques, including combined waveforms, phase manipulation, inversion, and beating effects.</p>
<p>As we progress, we will explore the intricacies of FM synthesis, explaining how FM works, the impact of different waveforms, pulse-width modulation (PWM) using FM, basic routing setups, feedback, routing into effects, harmonics, FM with high and low pitch, and inverted waves.</p>
<p>In the final sections of the tutorial, we will tackle advanced synthesis techniques, including the creation of harmonic sounds, vocal synthesis, incorporating external audio, generating metallic sounds, and even venturing into physical modeling to emulate impulse and string-like timbres.</p>
<p>By the end of this FM8 Advanced Tutorial for Ableton Live, you will have gained a deep understanding of the synth&#39;s inner workings, and be equipped with a wealth of practical techniques and creative ideas to take your sound design and music productions to the next level. Let&#39;s dive in and unlock the true potential of FM8 in Ableton Live!</p>
<p><strong>Why a book?</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s 2024, people don&#39;t read books anymore. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. If I were to make a series of videos, it would be easy for you to just sit there consuming video after video, potentially learning nothing. It may feel as if you&#39;re learning, but you are more than likely just devoting your time into setting the values of knobs rather than understanding what&#39;s really going on. I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be even reading this book if you weren&#39;t taking sound design somewhat seriously either.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken courses online where I sat there with my eyes glazing over as I watched the instructor talking about avulsion and encroachments, but I didn&#39;t really learn anything until I sat down with the real estate book and read what it had to say, then wrote notes, checked my notes against online information and went back to reading. I was consuming the information, but not understanding a single thing. Reading books changes the way you think, and requires you to put mental work into learning which of course benefits you in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="about-me-" class="custom-heading">About me:</h2><p>I&#39;m Corbbin Goldsmith. I&#39;ve produced and published two albums, but have been producing music since 2006, when I got my first computer with GarageBand installed. I thought I could do everything on GarageBand, so I learned it from the inside out before realizing that FL Studio had more options, and would skip English, Math and Spanish to produce music, which looking back, was actually a pretty good choice. My lunch breaks were also about producing music and I am sure I left at least a few meals on that keyboard. And no, it was not a public school. </p>
<p>By the time I discovered Skrillex, I had been producing with FL Studio for 4 years and knew FL Studio inside out. Then, I changed some settings on my virtual machine, and I couldn&#39;t get the thing to work anymore and gave up my FL Studio rather than trying to figure it out. It was a good reason to move on to Ableton Live, which I already had installed on my computer. Live 8 would then be my DAW of choice from 2012 to 2024, and I continue to use it to this day, 12 years later. </p>
<p>Skrillex&#39;s sound design broke my brain. I had to figure out how he made his sounds, so I was determined to unlock all of his secrets. From 2012 to 2015, I barely left the house because I was learning FM8; all of its settings, waveforms, and how FM synthesis worked. That wasn&#39;t all, I got my virtual machine working again, and played around with Sytrus again, which has FM and AM synthesis, a very powerful combo. During these studies, I roughly maintained a YouTube channel where I focused on Skrillex basses, but I shared my music a bit there as well. Ableton Live provides Operator, which combines additive synthesis and FM synthesis, allowing you to create really unique sounds, something I have also gotten deep into. </p>
<p>In 2016, I went to the clubs and looked all over trying to get my dubstep fix, but it was nowhere to be found. Even my small town&#39;s &quot;Dubstep Night&quot; had been replaced by &quot;Trivia for Old Geezers&quot; or something similar, and no one wanted dubstep anymore. The buzz was killed and I diversified my music. However, my FM skills have only grown since I stopped making dubstep.</p>
