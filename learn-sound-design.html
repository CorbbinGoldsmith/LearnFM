            <h1 id="why-sound-design-" class="custom-heading">Why Sound Design?</h1><p>There are more and more artists every day, posting up their music, and most of the time, they are using presets to make the music they sell. If they like a sound, they won&#39;t mind dropping some money on it. This is why it&#39;s important for sound designers to exist. They solve a problem that music producers have.</p>
<p>The problem? Efficiency. The most efficient way to make music is to use samples and presets to get your songs out there before the trend is gone. Trends last about a week, so getting a song published as soon as possible is the only way to survive. </p>
<p>A musician might say, &quot;oh, well, using presets isn&#39;t actually music, now is it?&quot; It&#39;s disputed territory. On one hand, a producer is still producing music, but the methods they use are quick and easy. This allows them to focus on the end goal while getting a quick result. On the other hand, it&#39;s not taking the route of complete originality, where everything is made from the ground up.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, with the advent of AI, AI is not currently capable of making presets for things like FM8. Though artists in the future might be using AI to make music, I don&#39;t think they will even need plugins to make music, they will just state the qualities of each section or track of the song, and it will come out sounding how they want, or close enough. However, this comment might age like milk.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t at all change that there will be someone who knows how to make presets with plugins, because there will be people who want full control of the work, and will want something 100% reproducible to add their own effects and really be the master of their tracks.</p>
<p>The most renowned artists are ones who will add embellishments to their tracks, like messing around in post processing, having their own sorts of racks and methods to create a consistency across all tracks or across an album. These artists are the ones that AI cannot reproduce because they are trailblazers for the next era in music. </p>
<p>This could be you. Or it could be someone you inspire. Being a sound designer means you have command over the sounds you create. It puts you at the forefront of music, and allows you to set trends or try new things that have never been done before. It doesn&#39;t mean you will be able to make the same sound over and over again, but it allows you the ability to have a consistency you can call yours. </p>
<p>And that is what sound design is.</p>
<p>Fear not the AI who is consuming your work. They will not be the ones to take things in your directions. It cannot extrapolate the mind of a human, and take things in the exact direction they are supposed to be taken. It can only follow you. And if you&#39;re better and faster than the AI, you will be fine.</p>
<h2 id="my-history" class="custom-heading">My history</h2><p>I started learning FM synthesis in 2013. I spent hours just looking at how each wave would effect the other, and if I close my eyes, I can see the sounds I&#39;m hearing from the synthesizer. If you&#39;re studying FM synthesis enough, you too will be able to do this. </p>
