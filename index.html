            <h1 id="let-39-s-face-it" class="custom-heading">Let&#39;s face it</h1><p>You&#39;ve probably landed yourself here because you&#39;ve been working for hours trying to wrap your head around FM, trying to make things work, but you just can&#39;t do it. You&#39;ve been watching all the stars posting up new tracks, and you just can&#39;t keep up. Skrillex has evolved to a new level, but even his humble beginnings make you think that he learned all of this in one day.</p>
<p>You&#39;re probably in tears right now just trying to imagine why you fell down this FM rabbit hole and now you want to know more, but you have nowhere to go. So you&#39;ve landed yourself here.</p>
<p><strong>Let me explain why your day just got better.</strong></p>
<p>I have been studying FM for 13 years. I&#39;ve stepped away from FM to learn about using things called &quot;presets&quot; but that was a very short stint that I may not ever go back to. I also happened to learn signal processing from a NASA engineer who was teaching at a University and took me on as a student like a proper Will Hunting. I know FM, FFT, the mathematics of filters both analog and digital, I can count to a million in binary, and I&#39;ve even coded websites and can write all the code to do signal processing.</p>
<p>FM is an integral part of a lot of synthesizers, and once you&#39;re the master of it, it takes you to a new level. That&#39;s what they say, and when you hear the results, it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s true. </p>
